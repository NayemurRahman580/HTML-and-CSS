            “I came to you because I want to tell my story,” the man on Dr. Harper's
couch was saying. The man was Lester Billings from Waterbury,
Connecticut. According to the history taken from Nurse Vickers, he was
twenty-eight, employed by an industrial firm in New York, divorced, and
the father of three children. All deceased.
“I can't go to a priest because I'm not Catholic. I can't go to a lawyer
because I haven't done anything to consult a lawyer about. All I did was
kill my kids. One at a time. Killed them all.”
Dr. Harper turned on the tape recorder.
Billings lay straight as a yardstick on the couch, not giving it an inch of
himself. His feet protruded stiffly over the end. Picture of a man enduring
necessary humiliation. His hands were folded corpselike on his chest. His
face was carefully set. He looked at the plain white composition ceiling as
if seeing scenes and pictures played out there.
“Do you mean you actually killed them, or—”
“No.” Impatient flick of the hand. “But I was responsible. Denny in
1967. Shirl in 1971. And Andy this year. I want to tell you about it.”
Dr. Harper said nothing. He thought that Billings looked haggard and
old. His hair was thinning, his complexion sallow. His eyes held all the
miserable secrets of whiskey.
“They were murdered, see? Only no one believes that. If they would,
things would be all right.”
“Why is that?”
“Because . . .”
Billings broke off and darted up on his elbows, staring across the room.
“What's that?” he barked. His eyes had narrowed to black slots.
“What's what?”
“That door.”
“The closet,” Dr. Harper said. “Where I hang my coat and leave my
overshoes.”
“Open it. I want to see.” Dr. Harper got up wordlessly, crossed the room, and opened the closet.
Inside, a tan raincoat hung on one of four or five hangers. Beneath that was
a pair of shiny galoshes. The New York Times had been carefully tucked
into one of them. That was all.
“All right?” Dr. Harper said.
“All right.” Billings removed the props of his elbows and returned to his
previous position.
“You were saying,” Dr. Harper said as he went back to his chair, “that if
the murder of your three children could be proved, all your troubles would
be over. Why is that?”
“I'd go to jail,” Billings said immediately. “For life. And you can see
into all the rooms in a jail. All the rooms.” He smiled at nothing.
“How were your children murdered?”
“Don't try to jerk it out of me!”
Billings twitched around and stared balefully at Harper.
“I'll tell you, don't worry. I'm not one of your freaks strutting around and
pretending to be Napoleon or explaining that I got hooked on heroin
because my mother didn't love me. I know you won't believe me. I don't
care. It doesn't matter. Just to tell will be enough.”
“All right.” Dr. Harper got out his pipe.
“I married Rita in 1965—I was twenty-one and she was eighteen. She
was pregnant. That was Denny.” His lips twisted in a rubbery, frightening
grin that was gone in a wink. “I had to leave college and get a job, but I
didn't mind. I loved both of them. We were very happy.
“Rita got pregnant just a little while after Denny was born, and Shirl
came along in December of 1966. Andy came in the summer of 1969, and
Denny was already dead by then. Andy was an accident. That's what Rita
said. She said sometimes that birth-control stuff doesn't work. I think that
it was more than an accident. Children tie a man down, you know. Women
like that, especially when the man is brighter than they. Don't you find
that's true?”
Harper grunted noncommittally.
“It doesn't matter, though. I loved him anyway.” He said it almost
vengefully, as if he had loved the child to spite his wife.
“Who killed the children?” Harper asked.
“The boogeyman,” Lester Billings answered immediately. “The
boogeyman killed them all. Just came out of the closet and killed them.”
He twisted around and grinned. “You think I'm crazy, all right. It's written
all over you. But I don't care. All I want to do is tell you and then get lost.”
“I'm listening,” Harper said.
“It started when Denny was almost two and Shirl was just an infant. He
started crying when Rita put him to bed. We had a two-bedroom place, see.
Shirl slept in a crib in our room. At first I thought he was crying because
he didn't have a bottle to take to bed anymore. Rita said don't make an
issue of it, let it go, let him have it and he'll drop it on his own. But that's
the way kids start off bad. You get permissive with them, spoil them. Then
they break your heart. Get some girl knocked up, you know, or start
shooting dope. Or they get to be sissies. Can you imagine waking up some
morning and finding your kid—your son—is a sissy?
“After a while, though, when he didn't stop, I started putting him to bed
myself. And if he didn't stop crying I'd give him a whack. Then Rita said
he was saying light’ over and over again. Well, I didn't know. Kids that
little, how can you tell what they're saying. Only a mother can tell.
“Rita wanted to put in a nightlight. One of those wall-plug things with
Mickey Mouse or Huckleberry Hound or something on it. I wouldn't let
her. If a kid doesn't get over being afraid of the dark when he's little, he
never gets over it.
“Anyway, he died the summer after Shirl was born. I put him to bed that
night and he started to cry right off. I heard
what he said that time. He pointed right at the closet when he said it.
‘Boogeyman,’ the kid says. ‘Boogeyman, Daddy.’
“I turned off the light and went into our room and asked Rita why she
wanted to teach the kid a word like that. I was tempted to slap her around a
little, but I didn't. She said she never taught him to say that. I called her a
goddamn liar.
“That was a bad summer for me, see. The only job I could get was
loading Pepsi-Cola trucks in a warehouse, and I was tired all the time.
Shirl would wake up and cry every night and Rita would pick her up and
sniffle. I tell you, sometimes I felt like throwing them both out a window.
Christ, kids drive you crazy sometimes. You could kill them.
“Well, the kid woke me at three in the morning, right on schedule. I
went to the bathroom, only a quarter awake, you know, and Rita asked me
if I'd check on Denny. I told her to do it herself and went back to bed. I was
almost asleep when she started to scream.
“I got up and went in. The kid was dead on his back. Just as white as
flour except for where the blood had . . . had sunk. Back of the legs, the
head, the a—the buttocks. His eyes were open. That was the worst, you
know. Wide open and glassy, like the eyes you see on a moosehead some
guy put over his mantel. Like pictures you see of those gook kids over in
Nam. But an American kid shouldn't look like that. Dead on his back.
Wearing diapers and rubber pants because he'd been wetting himself again
the last couple of weeks. Awful, I loved that kid.”
Billings shook his head slowly, then offered the rubbery, frightening
grin again. “Rita was screaming her head off. She tried to pick Denny up
and rock him, but I wouldn't let her. The cops don't like you to touch any
of the evidence. I know that—”
“Did you know it was the boogeyman then?” Harper asked quietly.
“Oh, no. Not then. But I did see one thing. It didn't mean anything to me
then, but my mind stored it away.”
“What was that?”
“The closet door was open. Not much. Just a crack. But I knew I left it
shut, see. There's dry-cleaning bags in there. A kid messes around with one
of those and bango. Asphyxiation. You know that?”
“Yes. What happened then?”
Billings shrugged. “We planted him.” He looked morbidly at his hands,
which had thrown dirt on three tiny coffins.
“Was there an inquest?”
“Sure.” Billings eyes flashed with sardonic brilliance. “Some backcountry
fuckhead with a stethoscope and a black bag full of Junior Mints
and a sheepskin from some cow college. Crib death, he called it! You ever
hear such a pile of yellow manure? The kid was three years old!”
“Crib death is most common during the first year,” Harper said
carefully, “but that diagnosis has gone on death certificates for children up
to age five for want of a better—”
“Bullshit!” Billings spat out violently.
Harper relit his pipe.
“We moved Shirl into Denny's old room a month after the funeral. Rita
fought it tooth and nail, but I had the last word. It hurt me, of course it did.
Jesus, I loved having the kid in with us. But you can't get overprotective.
You make a kid a cripple that way. When I was a kid my mom used to take
me to the beach and then scream herself hoarse. ‘Don't go out so far! Don't
go there! It's got an undertow! You only ate an hour ago! Don't go over
your head!’ Even to watch out for sharks, before God. So what happens? I
can't even go near the water now. It's the truth. I get the cramps if I go near
a beach. Rita got me to take her and the kids to Savin Rock once when
Denny was alive. I got sick as a dog. I know, see? You can't overprotect
kids. And you can't coddle yourself either. Life goes on. Shirl went right
into Denny's crib. We sent the old mattress to the dump, though. I didn't
want my girl to get any germs.
“So a year goes by. And one night when I'm putting Shirl into her crib
she starts to yowl and scream and cry. ‘Boogeyman, Daddy, boogeyman,
boogeyman!’
“That threw a jump into me. It was just like Denny. And I started to
remember about that closet door, open just a crack when we found him. I
wanted to take her into our room for the night.”
“Did you?”
“No.” Billings regarded his hands and his face twitched. “How could I
go to Rita and admit I was wrong? I had to be strong. She was always such
a jellyfish . . . look how easy she went to bed with me when we weren't
married.”
Harper said, “On the other hand, look how easily you went to bed with
her.”
Billings froze in the act of rearranging his hands and slowly turned his
head to look at Harper. “Are you trying to be a wise guy?”
“No, indeed,” Harper said.
“Then let me tell it my way,” Billings snapped. “I came here to get this
off my chest. To tell my story. I'm not going to talk about my sex life, if
that's what you expect. Rita and I had a very normal sex life, with none of
that dirty stuff. I know it gives some people a charge to talk about that, but
I'm not one of them.”
“Okay,” Harper said.
“Okay,” Billings echoed with uneasy arrogance. He seemed to have lost
the thread of his thought, and his eyes wandered uneasily to the closet
door, which was firmly shut.
“Would you like that open?” Harper asked.
“No!” Billings said quickly. He gave a nervous little laugh. “What do I
want to look at your overshoes for?
“The boogeyman got her, too,” Billings said. He brushed at his
forehead, as if sketching memories. “A month later. But something
happened before that. I heard a noise in there one night. And then she
screamed. I opened the door real quick—the hall light was on—and . . .
she was sitting up in the crib crying and . . . something moved. Back in the
shadows, by the closet. Something slithered”
“Was the closet door open?”
“A little. Just a crack.” Billings licked his lips. “Shirl was screaming
about the boogeyman. And something else that sounded like ‘claws.’ Only
she said ‘craws,’ you know. Little kids have trouble with that ‘l’ sound.
Rita ran upstairs and asked what the matter was. I said she got scared by
the shadows of the branches moving on the ceiling.”
“Crawset?” Harper said.
“Huh?”
“Crawset . . . closet. Maybe she was trying to say ‘closet.’ “
“Maybe,” Billings said. “Maybe that was it. But I don't think so. I think
it was ‘claws.’” His eyes began seeking the closet door again. “Claws, long
claws.” His voice had sunk to a whisper.
“Did you look in the closet?” <br>
“Y-yes.” Billings’ hands were laced tightly across his chest, laced
tightly enough to show a white moon at each knuckle. <br>
“Was there anything in there? Did you see the—” <br>
“I didn't see anything!” Billings screamed suddenly. And the words
poured out as if a black cork had been pulled from the bottom of his soul:
“When she died I found her, see. And she was black. All black. She
swallowed her own tongue and she was just as black as a nigger in a
minstrel show and she was staring at me. Her eyes, they looked like those
eyes you see on stuffed animals, all shiny and awful, like live marbles, and
they were saying it got me, Daddy, you let it get me, you killed me, you
helped it kill me . . .” His words trailed off. One single tear very large and
silent, ran down the side of his cheek. <br>
“It was a brain convulsion, see? Kids get those sometimes. A bad signal
from the brain. They had an autopsy at Hartford Receiving and they told us
she choked on her tongue from the convulsion. And I had to go home alone
because they kept Rita under sedation. She was out of her mind. I had to
go back to that house all alone, and I know a kid don't just get convulsions
because their brain frigged up. You can scare a kid into convulsions. And I
had to go back to the house where it was.”<br>
He whispered, “I slept on the couch. With the light on.”
“Did anything happen?” <br>
“I had a dream,” Billings said. “I was in a dark room and there was
something I couldn't . . . couldn't quite see, in the closet. It made a noise . .
. a squishy noise. It reminded me of a comic book I read when I was a kid.
Tales from the Crypt, you remember that? Christ! They had a guy named
Graham Ingles; he could draw every god-awful thing in the world—and
some out of it. Anyway, in this story this woman drowned her husband,
see? Put cement blocks on his feet and dropped him into a quarry. Only he
came back. He was all rotted and black-green and the fish had eaten away
one of his eyes and there was seaweed in his hair. He came back and killed
her. And when I woke up in the middle of the night, I thought that would
be leaning over me. With claws . . . long claws . . .” <br>
Dr. Harper looked at the digital clock inset into his desk. Lester Billings
had been speaking for nearly half an hour. He said, “When your wife came
back home, what was her attitude toward you?” <br>
“She still loved me,” Billings said with pride. “She still wanted to do
what I told her. That's the wife's place, right? This women's lib only makes
sick people. The most important thing in life is for a person to know his
place. His . . . his . . . uh . . .”
“Station in life?” <br>
“That's it!” Billings snapped his fingers. “That's it exactly. And a wife
should follow her husband. Oh, she was sort of colorless the first four or
five months after—dragged around the house, didn't sing, didn't watch the
TV, didn't laugh. I knew she'd get over it. When they're that little, you
don't get so attached to them. After a while you have to go to the bureau
drawer and look at a picture to even remember exactly what they looked
<br>
“She wanted another baby,” he added darkly. “I told her it was a bad
idea. Oh, not forever, but for a while. I told her it was a time for us to get
over things and begin to enjoy each other. We never had a chance to do that
before. If you wanted to go to a movie, you had to hassle around for a
baby-sitter. You couldn't go into town to see the Mets unless her folks
would take the kids, because my mom wouldn't have anything to do with
us. Denny was born too soon after we were married, see? She said Rita was
just a tramp, a common little corner-walker. Corner-walker is what my
mom always called them. Isn't that a sketch? She sat me down once and
told me diseases you can get if you went to a cor . . . to a prostitute. How
your pri . . . your penis has just a little tiny sore on it one day and the next
day it's rotting right off. She wouldn't even come to the wedding.”
